# Week One:


This week, I created a leaflet map based on last week's assignment. I made a map from scratch, and the whole process was much easier than the first time, because this time I had a much better understanding of what I was doing. That gave me hope, because the first time I did it, it was an incredibly lengthy and tedious process. This time, it was equally as tedious but less lengthy. I created a "world map," one that does in fact, show the whole world, and put pins in famous cities. My goal was to put 10-15 all over the world and I ended up doing 12. Getting the information for each pin was interesting and fun, as I have been to almost every place on my map, I chose places that I like and that I think are worth visiting. Then, like last week, I looked up on Google Maps the coordinates to the locations of the places and put them in the coordinates area. Thus, I had my map.


## Next Week and Beyond:
I also made buttons for the questions. Although they're not finished, they're all there, and they are clickable. I'll add the function for JS next week, as well as CSS for the map, make it responsive and beautiful with CSS and (hopefully!) add some audio clips when people choose the right answer to my quiz questions. The biggest challenge, as usual, was just being extra meticulous with all the extra moving parts - another json file, so many coordinates and cities, and all the information I had to copy and paste from my original document.


*You can see my original document for the pins' information in "cities.md" on GitHub.*

# Week Two:


This week, I continued my work with the map and images. I collected all 12 images (9/12 of places I've been to and images that are mine), and put them in my images folder. I also had to restructure my folder sequence becuase of the way GitHub creates a separate folder in my final_project folder, and that isn't what's standard practice. So once that was fixed, I worked on the buttons. I used a neat tool to help me design it, https://www.bestcssbuttongenerator.com/, and adapted one of the buttons I wanted to use based off of this. I put the parts in my HTML and CSS files.


I input the answers for the questions and made them radio buttons. Then, I tried to write a function that would make them drop when clicked. It was very difficult and time consuming to figure out this step. After trying about 50 different things, between Google and other projects, I figured out the this, children and class connection. Now, when the buttons are clicked, the answers drop down. It's not pretty (yet), and nothing happens when you click an answer, but that's for next week.

## Week Three:


I will have a box pop up when an answer is clicked, and either celebrate or say "try again" in the language of the country based on the answer that's clicked. I will add CSS and make it responsive, and finish adding the jQuery and Javascript to make it beautiful, with fonts and colors and other visually appealing things. If I can make it happen, I'll make the background image of the box that pops up the pictures from each country that I've added to my images folder.

*Note, I know the HTML doesn't quite validate because of some of the mistakes in the buttons, but they do work. I'm not sure if this is actually a real issue or not, but I don't know how else to test that.
