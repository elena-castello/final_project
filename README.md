# Week One:


This week, I created a leaflet map based on last week's assignment. I made a map from scratch, and the whole process was much easier than the first time, because this time I had a much better understanding of what I was doing. That gave me hope, because the first time I did it, it was an incredibly lengthy and tedious process. This time, it was equally as tedious but less lengthy. I created a "world map," one that does in fact, show the whole world, and put pins in famous cities. My goal was to put 10-15 all over the world and I ended up doing 12. Getting the information for each pin was interesting and fun, as I have been to almost every place on my map, I chose places that I like and that I think are worth visiting. Then, like last week, I looked up on Google Maps the coordinates to the locations of the places and put them in the coordinates area. Thus, I had my map.


## Next Week and Beyond:
I also made buttons for the questions. Although they're not finished, they're all there, and they are clickable. I'll add the function for JS next week, as well as CSS for the map, make it responsive and beautiful with CSS and (hopefully!) add some audio clips when people choose the right answer to my quiz questions. The biggest challenge, as usual, was just being extra meticulous with all the extra moving parts - another json file, so many coordinates and cities, and all the information I had to copy and paste from my original document.
